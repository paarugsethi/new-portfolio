DAOs are formed around consensus and solving common problems.

One such problem the [Superteam DAO](https://www.twitter.com/superteamDAO) has set out to solve is how to onboard people working in web2 onto web3. This is what inspired the project [Ground Zero](https://groundzero.superteam.fun/), which is an attempt to provide a repository of resources and educational content to help convert the next generation of normies to full-time degens.

## Education in Web3
A common mistake that’s very easy to make while thinking about this is to consider this shift as merely a technological upgrade. While partially true, the shift from web2 to web3 takes much more than that. It requires an update in our biological software as well - how we think about technology and the world at large.

A need for a shift in technology as well as our mental models around it results in a learning curve much steeper than one’s initial estimates. This was a common theme we found to be missing while researching about the education already out there.

> Web3 is extremely well documented, but equally fragmented.

This is something we sought out to solve and the goal became to optimise for education but along with relevant context and not losing that human touch. The key here was to walk the fine line between “good understanding but not enough knowledge” and a complete “information overload”. This led to the framework that we decided to follow for every domain we wanted to cover, courtesy of the brilliant Aditya Shetty, a fellow member at the Superteam DAO.
