I grew up being taught that having general awareness and being up to date with current events was essential to your overall development as a member of society.

This sentiment stayed with me throughout my school life and into my early adulthood as well.

I was always reading or learning about whatever the current “problem” was. The thought process behind that was that even if some issue doesn’t affect me directly, it was my moral responsibility to know and in fact, learn about it. Ignorance was not just an immense amount of privilege but also a political statement in itself that I’m with the oppressor. “If you have something to say, silence is a lie”.

Every scam, every scandal, every crime, every protest, and every bill passed was my problem and learning and talking about it is how I fulfilled my responsibility as a “virtuous” citizen. In hindsight, social media was a big contributor to that fire as it gave me an outlet to broadcast my thoughts to the world (or, my subset of the world) which made me feel like a celebrity of sorts.

What do most celebrities do on social media? They virtue signal.

## But I don’t do it anymore.
