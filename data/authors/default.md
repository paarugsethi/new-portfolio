A curious individual with a passion for attempting big things and being humbled by them. I'm always looking for asymmetry and I'm intrigued by what captures human attention.

Iâ€™m a content creator, marketer and podcaster working full-time in web3 and have worked with various projects in the ecosystem. I also have a [blog](https://www.wordcelclub.com/paarug.sol) in which I write about everything life, tech and the future. I'm also a martial artist which has helped me to understand people better, communicate clearly and have a solution-oriented mindset toward life.

- Currently leading marketing and communications for [Wordcel](https://twitter.com/wordcel_club), a decentralised social protocol on Solana.
- I'm also a member and head of the host committee within the [SuperteamDAO](https://twitter.com/SuperteamDAO).
- Worked on a bunch of open-sourced projects like the [Superteam Talent Guide](https://talent.superteam.fun/) and [Ground Zero](https://groundzero.superteam.fun/).
- I've also worked with various other projects helping them with their content and marketing including [CapX](https://twitter.com/CapxFi), [Mesha](https://twitter.com/meshaclub) etc.
- Previously wrote content for [Timeswap Labs](https://twitter.com/TimeswapLabs).
- I have a graduate degree in Bachelor of Management Studies from Delhi University and have also pursued Full-Stack Web Development from [Masai School](https://twitter.com/masaischool).
- I also co-host a podcast called [Slippery Slopes](https://linktr.ee/slipperyslopes) in which we go over everything that's happening around the world relating to the myriad of domains that pique my interest.

If you'd like to talk about web3, tech, coffee or anything else in general, reach out to me [@paarugsethi](https://twitter.com/paarugsethi) on Twitter and I'd love to have a chat!
