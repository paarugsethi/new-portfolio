A curious individual always looking for the highest standard of whatever I'm involved in.

Iâ€™m a marketer, X "intern", community curator and indie builder working full-time in web3 (mostly Solana). I also have a [blog](https://paarugsethi.substack.com/) in which I infrequently write about everything life, tech and the future. I'm also a martial artist which has helped me to understand people better, communicate clearly and have a solution-oriented mindset toward life.
