DAOs or Decentralised Autonomous Organisations have to be one of the most fascinating outcomes that have come about during the crypto revolution.

### So let’s first consider what a DAO is
A DAO is often described as sort of a “Reddit community with a bank account.”

In an attempt to formalise this definition, we can say it’s an organisation structured in a way that the control and ownership of its decisions are decentralised and spread out amongst its members through some rules that are enforced on the blockchain.

In a DAO, the jobs that have to be carried out are determined by pre-written smart contracts.
