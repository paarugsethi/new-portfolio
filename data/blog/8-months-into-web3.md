A few weeks back I shared a tweet thread that went viral (at least by my standards) about how I got into web3 and what I have been up to in this space ever since.

If you haven't read it yet, here's the tweet.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I went from being a non-tech college student with no work experience to working full time in web3 within 8 months.üåê<br/><br/>A laptop and an internet connection are all I had.<br/><br/>Story time.üßµ</p>&mdash; Paarug Sethi (@paarugsethi) <a href="https://twitter.com/paarugsethi/status/1528379386101018624?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 22, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The reason I'm writing this blog however is to first-of-all bring it on-chain but also to reflect a bit on why it clicked with so many people out there.
