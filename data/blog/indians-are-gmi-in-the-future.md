Times have changed. The tables have turned. The playing field is now level. The Indian can now dare to be sovereign with the internet in his pocket.

The conversation between [Balaji Srinivasan](https://twitter.com/balajis) with [Akshay BD](https://twitter.com/akshaybd) and [Tanmay Bhat](https://twitter.com/thetanmay) on the [Superteam DAO](https://twitter.com/superteamDAO)’s recent podcast painted a rationally optimistic picture about what the future in a decentralised world looks like for the working Indian and the Indian state at large.

This is a summary of the conversation along with a few of my notes and observations.

## Bullish on Indians
Balaji’s recent thesis on being extremely bullish on Indians while being moderately bullish on India is an interesting outlook on what the future could look like.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Moderately bullish on India, extremely bullish on Indians.</p>&mdash; Balaji (@balajis) <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1446411161742675969?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 8, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

His thesis is based on the fact that while the Indian state is doing good things with the advent of the IndiaStack, the initial Indians who have made their way into countries like the US, UK, Canada etc. have exceeded expectations at the global level.

The Indian being globally mobile, unlike the Chinese, therefore doesn’t need the Indian State’s continued execution to excel individually. Indian citizens are much more willing to move out from their homeland and set up in places that legally favour the domain they’re working in.

The age-old challenge of lack of mobility is no longer a problem and unlike a Chinese citizen who’s under a much more centralised regime, and would probably be less globally mobile, Indians are much more likely to be moving out to a jurisdiction that favours them.
